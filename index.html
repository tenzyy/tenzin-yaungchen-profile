<h1> SHORT BIO </h1>
<p> My nationality is Tibetan. Born & Raised in India. My parents decided Canada was a better home for us, so we moved 
to Toronto in 2002. My 
parents were pretty strict but I have always been free spirited and adventerous so, in 2014 I moved to Vancouver against 
my parents approval. I never regret it because I have been travelling the world ever since, working hard as a 
waitress and travelling to one of the most beautiful places in the world.
